# Local-Search-Algorithms-for-Neural-Architecture-Search-in-Super-Resolution
This repository offers versatile evaluation functions and local search algorithms—Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, and Simulated Annealing—for neural architecture search. Designed to work with any binary or Gray code-encoded search space, it facilitates the optimization of architectures based on metrics like PSNR, SynFlow, FLOPs, and parameter count.
